# JavaLabs
**Recursion** is a technique that leads to elegant solutions to problems that are difficult to
program using simple loops. Recursion is an alternative form of program control. It is essentially repetition
without a loop.

**Requirements:**
1. A Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
   
2.A GitHub account

**Instructions:**
1. Clone the repo files to your local machine.
2. Create a Java class named **Recursion**, and implement one of the following cases:
   
   a. fibonacci(n): Calculates the nth Fibonacci number.

   b. power(x, n): Calculates the power of a number x raised to a non-negative integer n.

   c. reverseString(str): Reverses a given string str.
   
   d. palindrome(str): Checks whether a given string str is a palindrome.
   
   e. Write a recursive method named countDown that takes an integer parameter and prints a countdown from that number to 1, test your countDown method with different input values.

   f.Write a recursive method named binarySearch that performs a binary search on a sorted array.

   g. Using a recursive method, find a path through a maze from the start to the end. Recursive solution involves exploring each possible move until a solution is found.

   H. Implement** Merge Sort Function ** using recursion approach.

   I. N-Queens problem, or Sudoku solving solving using recursion approach.

   J. Reverse a **Linked List ** using recursive funciton.

   K. Travel Traversal: using a recursive function, traverse through the nodes of a **Tree data structure**. Recursive solution include in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.
   
3.For each method, write a unit test case to verify its correctness.

4. Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository.

5. Optional Task - Implement another version of your method using an **iterative (normal loop)** approach and compare its efficiency to the recursion version.

Note: to complete this task, the following processes are helpful:
- git clone https://github.com/altrad-novelty/JavaLabs.gitLinks to an external site.
- open new branch/fork in github from the invitation link, this to push your solution under your name.
- Links to an external site.git remote set-url --push origin https://github.com/...your-forked-repositoryLinks to an external site.
- update file and git add .
- git commit -m "MESSAGE"
- git push
